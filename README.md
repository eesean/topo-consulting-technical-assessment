# topo-consulting-technical-assessment

## Approach to assessment
My application makes use of Python libraries to read data from different types of files and merging them these data together to form a unified structure. The tech stack comprises of React as the frontend and Flask as the backend, and I create an endpoint for Axios to retrieve the data.

## To run Python Backend:
1. py server.py

## To run React Frontend:
1. cd client
2. npm start
